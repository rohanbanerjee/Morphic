> Privacy preserving data analytics platform - AngelHack 2019
Morphic is a privacy-preserving analytics service built for companies that need analytics and query services on private data. This allows companies to pool data with competitors without comprising user privacy or losing business advantage. Our system receives encrypted data from companies, and offers storage, query, and analytics services on this data. We built this using award-winning research on combining multi-party computation and federated learning done at Next Tech Lab.
